My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains several projects and assignments I have completed during my studies in computer science.

SQL Dairy Farm Group Project

The SQL Dairy Farm Group Project is a database management system for a dairy farm. Our group was tasked with designing and implementing a database that would track the inventory of milk, cheese, and other dairy products produced and sold by the farm. The project was developed using SQL and includes a detailed ER diagram, a relational schema, and sample queries.

C++ Tower Defense Game Project

The C++ Tower Defense Game Project is a tower defense game developed using C++. The game features several levels, each with increasing difficulty, and various towers and enemies. The project includes source code and detailed documentation on how the game was designed and developed.

C++ Assignments

The C++ Assignments folder contains several C++ assignments I have completed throughout my studies. The assignments cover various topics, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming. Each assignment includes source code and a brief description of the assignment.

Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects or assignments in this repository, simply navigate to the appropriate folder and review the documentation and source code. To run the C++ projects, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system.
