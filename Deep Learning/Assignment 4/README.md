## Overview
In Assignment 4, we implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model sequential data. The goal is to learn the temporal dependencies within the input sequences and predict future tokens or sequence labels. This assignment includes all aspects of RNN training—from data preprocessing to model evaluation—using a deep learning framework.

## Objectives
- Develop an RNN model for sequence prediction.
- Preprocess and tokenize sequential data.
- Train the RNN model and monitor performance metrics such as loss and accuracy.
- Evaluate the model by generating sample outputs and analyzing its predictions.

## Implementation Details

### Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Load sequential data from a text source or CSV file.
- Normalize text by converting to lowercase and removing punctuation.
- Tokenize the data into words or characters.
- Pad sequences to a fixed length for batching.
- Construct a vocabulary mapping tokens to integer indices.

### RNN Model Architecture
- **Embedding Layer**: Transforms input tokens into dense vector representations.
- **Recurrent Layer(s)**: Uses either a vanilla RNN, LSTM, or GRU to process the sequence and capture temporal dependencies.
- **Output Layer**: A fully connected layer that outputs logits for the prediction of the next token or sequence label.
- Optionally, dropout is applied to prevent overfitting.

### Training Procedure
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- Use cross-entropy loss as the objective function.
- Train the model using an optimizer (e.g., Adam) with a suitable learning rate.
- Monitor training and validation loss over epochs to check for convergence.
- Implement early stopping if validation loss does not improve.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Evaluate the model using loss (cross-entropy) and, if applicable, accuracy or perplexity.
- Generate sample sequences from the trained model to qualitatively assess performance.

## Results & Visualizations
- **Loss Curves**: Plots showing training and validation loss decreasing over epochs.
- **Sample Predictions**: Generated sequences or predicted tokens demonstrate that the model has learned meaningful temporal patterns.
- **Embedding Visualization**: (Optional) t-SNE or PCA plots of the learned embeddings to illustrate clustering of similar tokens.

## Conclusion
The implemented RNN model successfully learns sequence dependencies and produces reasonable predictions. The training process shows steady convergence, and the generated samples indicate that the model captures the underlying structure of the sequential data. Future improvements may include experimenting with more advanced recurrent units (e.g., LSTM or GRU), tuning hyperparameters further, or incorporating attention mechanisms for enhanced performance.
