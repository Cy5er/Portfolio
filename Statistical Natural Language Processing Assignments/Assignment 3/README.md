## Overview
In **Assignment 4**, the focus is on developing a Visual Semantic Matching System. The objective is to bridge the gap between visual data (images) and textual data (descriptions) by extracting robust image features and converting text into semantic embeddings. The final system matches images with their most relevant text descriptions and vice versa.

## Requirements & Tasks

### Part 1: Feature Extraction from Images
- **Goal**: Extract robust visual features from input images.
- **Approach**:
  1. Utilize a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (e.g., VGG, ResNet) to extract deep features.
  2. Optionally, fine-tune the network on a domain-specific dataset if necessary.
- **Outcome**: A set of feature vectors that accurately represent the visual content of each image.

---

### Part 2: Semantic Embedding of Text Descriptions
- **Goal**: Convert textual descriptions into fixed-length semantic embeddings.
- **Approach**:
  1. Preprocess text by cleaning, tokenizing, and normalizing.
  2. Use a transformer-based model (e.g., BERT or Sentence-BERT) to generate semantic vectors.
- **Outcome**: A set of semantic embeddings that capture the meaning of each text description.

---

### Part 3: Matching Visual and Textual Data
- **Goal**: Align image features and text embeddings in a common space to enable matching.
- **Approach**:
  1. Compute similarity scores (e.g., cosine similarity) between image feature vectors and text embeddings.
  2. Retrieve the best matching textual descriptions for a given image and vice versa.
- **Outcome**: A working matching system that successfully retrieves corresponding text for images and images for text.

---

## Implementation Highlights
- **Image Processing**: Employed a pre-trained CNN for robust feature extraction from images.
- **Text Embedding**: Leveraged transformer-based models to create meaningful semantic representations of text.
- **Similarity Matching**: Used cosine similarity to compare embeddings from both modalities.
- **Evaluation**: Visualized results and computed retrieval metrics to assess the matching performance.

## Conclusion
The Visual Semantic Matching System successfully integrates visual feature extraction and textual semantic embedding to match images with relevant text descriptions. The approach demonstrates promising retrieval performance and paves the way for applications in image retrieval, captioning, and multimedia search. Future work may include further fine-tuning of embeddings and exploring alternative similarity measures to enhance matching accuracy.
