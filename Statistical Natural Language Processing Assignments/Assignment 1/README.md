## Overview
This notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline for processing raw text data. The workflow includes loading data, cleaning and normalizing text, tokenizing, removing stopwords, applying stemming/lemmatization, and extracting text features. The final processed text is suitable for downstream NLP tasks such as classification, clustering, or sentiment analysis.

---

## Objectives
- Load and inspect raw text data.
- Clean the text by removing unwanted characters and standardizing the format.
- Normalize the text (convert to lowercase, remove punctuation).
- Tokenize the text into individual words.
- Remove common stopwords and apply stemming or lemmatization.
- Extract features (e.g., term frequency, n-grams) for further analysis.

---

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The notebook loads text data from a source file (CSV or plain text).
- Basic data cleaning is performed:
  - Removal of missing or duplicate entries.
  - Trimming extra whitespace and ensuring consistent encoding.
- The cleaned text is stored for subsequent processing steps.

---

## Text Normalization and Tokenization
- The text is converted to lowercase.
- Punctuation and special characters are removed.
- The normalized text is split into tokens (words), resulting in a list of tokens for each document.

---

## Stopword Removal and Stemming/Lemmatization
- Common stopwords (e.g., "the", "and", "is") are filtered out to reduce noise.
- Stemming or lemmatization is applied to convert words to their base form.
- This step reduces vocabulary size and improves the consistency of text features.

---

## Feature Extraction
- Basic text features are extracted from the processed data, including:
  - **Term Frequency (TF):** Counts of words in each document.
  - **N-grams:** Sequences of two or more tokens to capture contextual information.
  - Optionally, **TF-IDF** can be computed to weigh terms by their importance.
- These features can be used for further machine learning tasks.

---

## Results and Analysis
- Visualizations (e.g., word frequency histograms or word clouds) illustrate the distribution of words in the dataset.
- Sample outputs show the effect of normalization, tokenization, and stopword removal.
- Analysis confirms that the preprocessing pipeline effectively cleans and standardizes the raw text data.
